# IoT-Temp-Humidity-Monitor
ESP32 system programmed with ESP-IDF to read temperature and humidity sensors and publish data via Mosquitto MQTT. Telegraf collects the data and stores it in InfluxDB, while Grafana visualizes real-time metrics and enables local network users to control the system through an interactive dashboard.
